            A TEDx Talk is a showcase for speakers presenting great, well-formed
            ideas in under 18 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Why under 18 minutes?</b>
            <br />
            This short talk model works, since it only demands the audience’s
            attention for a short period of time, decreasing the chance of minds
            wandering or daydreaming about lunch. In fact, some of our greatest
            TED Talks have been as short as 5 minutes long!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What is a great, well-formed idea?</b>
            <br />
            It can actually be one of two things:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                Something that’s new and surprising; an idea or invention that
                your audience has never heard about.
              </li>
              <li>
                A great basic idea (that your audience has maybe already heard)
                with a compelling new argument behind it that challenges beliefs
                and perspectives.
              </li>
            </ul>
            In other words, an idea isn’t just a story or a list of facts. A
            good idea takes certain evidence or observations and draws a larger
            conclusion.

          <p>
            Fact-checking means going through a script’s empirical claims —
            basically, anything that can be verified in the real world — and
            making sure that they are as accurate as possible. There are real
            consequences to the talks you produce, since people will often
            change their behavior based on a talk that they watch. So, you want
            to be sure you are not accidentally sharing misinformation or
            disinformation on your TEDx stage. It protects the reputations of
            you, the speaker, the event, and TED at-large.

          <p>
            At TEDxBITJaipur, we’re building a stage for voices that often go
            unheard — the thinkers, the tinkerers, the quiet revolutionaries. We
            seek speakers who bring not just ideas, but the courage to reframe
            perspectives and move hearts. Whether you’re a first-time speaker or
            a seasoned storyteller, what matters most is the power of your idea
            and your willingness to shape it with intention.
          </p>
          <p>
            TEDx events, including ours, are fully volunteer-led — powered by
            passion, not profit. Every speaker is guided through a thoughtful
            curation journey to ensure their talk reaches its full potential.

              Please take time to understand and honor all TED, TEDx, and
              TEDxBITJaipur content guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Familiarize yourself with the spirit of our event theme (P.S. we
              might share a hint if you message us!) and consider how your idea
              might resonate with the theme’s depth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask yourself: <i>“Why me?”</i> and <i>“Why now?”</i> What makes
              your story or insight urgent, fresh, and transformative in this
              moment?
            </li>

              We encourage applicants with a connection to Jaipur or the broader
              Indian ecosystem, though applications are welcome from everywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
              Know that submitting your talk idea is only the beginning. If
              selected, you’ll work closely with our curation team to develop,
              refine, and rehearse your talk.
            </li>
            <li>
              We receive a high volume of applications and review each with
              care. While we may not be able to respond to every entry
              individually, please know that your voice matters and is
              appreciated.

            Remember, TEDxBITJaipur isn’t just about the talk — it’s about the
            idea, the energy, and the community you help create. We’re excited
            to see what you’ll bring to the stage.
